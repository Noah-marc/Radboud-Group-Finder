# Radboud-Group-Finder

General  Info about the code: 

RadboudGroupFinder is where you can find important things, as for example where you can change/add urls, create views, manage the settings

db.sqlite3 is the default database thata will always be created (i.e. if you delete the db and then run the dev server you will see that db.sqlite3 was created again

manage.py is the sort of the main. With this you can run certain commands, for example running the server (all the commands available can be senn by running  'python manage.py help' in the terminal/powershell on windows)

Scripts are just from my virtual environment, you most likely don't need this, since yoou should run your own virtual environment. I might delete this add some point 

requirements.txt contains what version I used to install django ('pip install django>=3.2,<3.3' works too in this case)
